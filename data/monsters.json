The Giant makes one attack with its fist against every creature within its reach. If no other creatures are within its reach, the Giant makes one fist attack against itself.<br>6–7. The Giant makes one attack with its bite against one random target within its reach. If no other creatures are within its reach, its eyes glaze over and it becomes stunned until the start of its next turn.<br>8–10. The Giant makes three attacks against one random target within its reach: one attack with its bite and two with its fists. If no other creatures are within its reach, the Giant flies into a rage and gains advantage on all attack rolls until the end of its next turn."

On a failed save, the creature takes 17 (5d6) bludgeoning damage, is knocked prone, and is trapped in the rubble. A trapped creature is restrained, requiring a successful DC 20 Strength (Athletics skill) check as an action to escape. Another creature within 5 feet of the buried creature can use its action to clear rubble and grant advantage on the check. If three creatures use their actions in this way, the check is an automatic success. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and doesn't fall prone or become trapped."
